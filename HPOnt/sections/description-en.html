Values of some of the HPOnt properties can be complex objects that usually include units of measurement, the measurement value, and some other optional parameters. However, sometimes a simple representation with a literal type value may suffice. In order to foster the reusability of the HPOnt, the choice of modelling this information is up to the ontology user.</span>
